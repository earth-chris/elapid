# Summary

Species distribution modeling (SDM) is based on the Grinellean niche concept: the environmental conditions that allow individuals of a species to survive and reproduce will constrain the distributions of those species over space and time [@Grinnell:1917; @Wiens:2009]. The inputs to these models are typically spatially-explicit species occurrence records and a series of environmental covariates, which might include information on climate, topography, land cover or hydrology [@Booth:2014]. While many modeling methods have been developed to quantify and map these species-environment interactions, few software systems include both a) the appropriate statistical modeling routines and b) support for handling the full suite of geospatial analysis required to prepare data to fit, apply, and summarize these models.

`elapid` is both a geospatial analysis and a species distribution modeling package. It provides an interface between vector and raster data for selecting random point samples, annotating point locations with coincident raster data, and summarizing raster values inside a polygon with zonal statistics. It provides a series of covariate transformation routines for increasing feature dimensionality, quantifying interaction terms and normalizing unit scales. It provides a Python implementation of the popular Maxent SDM [@Phillips:2017] using infinitely weighted logistic regression [@Fithian:2013]. It also includes a standard Niche Envelope Model [@Nix:1986], both of which were written to match the software design patterns of modern machine learning packages like `sklearn` [@sklearn]. It also allows users to add spatial context to any model by providing methods for spatially splitting train/test data and computing geographically-explicit sample weights. `elapid` was designed as a contemporary SDM package, built on best practices from the past and aspiring to support the next generation of biodiversity modeling workflows.

# Statement of need

Species occurrence data—georeferenced point locations where a species has been observed and identified—are an important resource for understanding the environmental conditions that predict habitat suitability for that species. These data are now abundant thanks to the proliferation of institutional open data policies, large-scale collaborations among research groups, and advances in the quality and popularity of citizen science applications [@gbif; @inaturalist]. Tools for working with these data haven't necessarily kept pace, however, especially ones that support modern geospatial data formats and machine learning workflows.

`elapid` builds on a suite of well-known statistical modeling tools commonly used by biogeographers, extending them to add novel features, to work with cloud-hosted data, and to save and share models. It provides methods for managing the full lifecyle of modeling data: generating background point data, extracting raster values for each point (i.e. point annotation), splitting train/test data, fitting models, and applying predictions to rasters. It provides a very high degree of control for model design, which is important for several reasons.

First is to provide simple and flexible methods for working with spatial data. Point data are managed as `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` objects [@geopandas], which can be easily merged and split using traditional indexing method as well as with geographic methods. They can also be reprojected on-the-fly. `elapid` reads and writes raster data with `rasterio`, which provides a similarly convenient set of methods for indexing and reading point locations from rasters [@rasterio]. These features are wrapped to handle many of the routine tasks and gotchas of working with geospatial data. It doesn't require data to be rigorously pre-processed so that all rasters are perfectly aligned, nor does it require that all datasets are in matching projections. `elapid` can extract pixel-level raster data from datasets at different resolutions, from multi-band files, and harmonize projections on-the-fly, for both model fitting and for inference.

Another advantage of `elapid`'s flexible design is that it can be used to extend traditional species distribution models in ways that are difficult to implement in other software systems. For example, working with multi-temporal data—fitting SDMs to occurrence records and environmental data from multiple time periods—is supported. Each time period's occurrence data can be annotated using the coincident environmental data. Random background samples can be generated for each time period, ensuring the background represents a broad distribution of conditions across the full temporal extent. These presence and background samples are then concatenated into a single `GeoDataFrame` for model fitting. Fitted models can be applied to multi-temporal environmental data to map changes in habitat suitability over time, and can also be saved and restored later for future inference.

`elapid` is one among several open source species distribution modeling packages. The R package `ENMeval` is a good direct comparison [@Kass:2021]. `ENMeval` provides a series of tools for model fitting, model selection and cross-validation, making calls under the hood to `maxnet` and `dismo` [@Phillips:2017]. `elapid` implements similar methods for spatial cross-validation, builds on the rich feature transformation tools implemented in `maxnet`, and employs similar model fitting techniques. `elapid` provides additional tools to simplify working with geospatial datasets, and provides additional novel cross-validation methods like geographic *k*-fold and buffered leave-one-out strategies [@Ploton:2020]. It is also one of the first open source species distribution modeling packages in Python, and it does not include any proprietary software dependencies [@Brown:2014].

# Why Maxent still matters

The main scientific contribution of `elapid` is extending and modifying the Maxent SDM, a model and software system as popular as it is maligned [@Phillips:2008; @Fourcade:2018]. First published in 2006, Maxent remains relevant because it's a presence-only model designed to work with the kinds of species occurrence data data that have proliferated lately.

Presence-only models formulate binary classification models as presence/background (1/0) instead of presence/absence, which changes how models are fit and interpreted [@Fithian:2013; @Merow:2013]. Background points are a spatially-random sample of the landscapes where a species might be found, which should be sampled with the same level of effort and bias as the species occurrence data. Presence/background models posit the null expectation that a species is equally likely to be found anywhere within it's range. Differences in environmental conditions between where a species occurs and across the full landscape should indicate niche preferences. Relative habitat suitability is then determined based on differences in the relative frequency distributions of conditions in these regions. Presence-only models reduce the burden of finding absence data, which are problematic to begin with, but they increase the burden of precisely selecting background points. These define what relative habitat suitability is relative *to* [@Elith:2011; @Barbet:2012].

`elapid` includes several methods for sampling the background. Points can be sampled uniformly within a polygon, like a range map or an ecoregion extent. Sampling points from rasters can be done uniformly across the full extent or only from pixels with valid, unmasked data. Working with bias rasters is also supported. Any raster with monotonically increasing values can be used as a sample probability map, increasing the probability that a sample is drawn in locations with higher pixel values. One important role for the niche envelope model is to create bias maps to ensure background points are only sampled within the broad climatic envelope where a species occurs. The target-group bias sampling method has also been shown to effectively correct for sample bias [@Barber:2022].

A common criticism of Maxent is that, though it depends on spatially-explicit data, it's not really a spatial model. Covariate data are indexed and extracted spatially, but there are no model terms based on location, distance, or point density, and all samples are treated as independent measurements. While some argue that many of the ails of spatial autocorrelation are typically overstated [@Hawkins:2012], spatial data have unique and very interesting properties that should be handled carefully. Non-independence is inherent to spatial data, driven both by underlying ecological patterns and processes (e.g. dispersal, species interactions, climatic covariance) as well as by data collection biases (e.g. occurrence records are common near roads or trails despite many species typically preferring less fragmented habitats).

Spatial models should include methods for handling spatially-specific modeling paradigms, particularly the lack of independence of nearby samples or spatial biases in sample density. Quantifying and understanding model skill requires accounting for these spatial autocorrelations, and `elapid` includes several methods for doing so. Checkerboard cross-validation can mitigate bias introduced by spatially clustered points. Creating spatially-explicit $k$-fold splits—independent clusters based on x/y locations—can quantify how well model predictions generalize to new areas. And tuning sample weights based on the density of nearby points decreases the risk of overfitting to autocorellated environmental features from areas with high sample density. This is particularly important for mitigating the effects of density-dependent non-independence.

These methods are not solely restricted to the SDMs implemented in `elapid`. They can add spatial context to other machine learning models, too. Geographic sample weights can be used to fit random forests, boosted regression trees, generalized linear models, and other approaches commonly used to predict spatial distributions. `elapid` also includes a series of feature transformers, including the transformations used in Maxent, which can extend covariate feature space to improve model skill.

`elapid` was designed to provide a series of modern tools for quantifying biodiversity change. The target audience for the package includes ecologists, biodiversity scientists, spatial analysts and machine learning scientists. Working with software to understand the rapid changes reshaping our biosphere should be easy and enjoyable. Because thinking about the ongoing annihilation of nature that's driving our current extinction crisis is decidedly less so.
