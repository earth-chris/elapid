  abstract = {Abstract Quantitative evaluations to optimize complexity have become standard for avoiding overfitting of ecological niche models (ENMs) that estimate species’ potential geographic distributions. ENMeval was the first R package to make such evaluations (often termed model tuning) widely accessible for the Maxent algorithm. It also provided multiple methods for partitioning occurrence data and reported various performance metrics. Requests by users, recent developments in the field, and needs for software compatibility led to a major redesign and expansion. We additionally conducted a literature review to investigate trends in ENMeval use (2015–2019). ENMeval 2.0 has a new object-oriented structure for adding other algorithms, enables customizing algorithmic settings and performance metrics, generates extensive metadata, implements a null-model approach to quantify significance and effect sizes, and includes features to increase the breadth of analyses and visualizations. In our literature review, we found insufficient reporting of model performance and parameterization, heavy reliance on model selection with AICc and low utilization of spatial cross-validation; we explain how ENMeval 2.0 can help address these issues. This redesigned and expanded version can promote progress in the field and improve the information available for decision-making.},

  abstract = {Summary Species distribution models (SDMs) are broadly used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Almost all SDM methods require extensive data preparation in a geographic information system (GIS) prior to model building. Often, this step is cumbersome and, if not properly done, can lead to poorly parameterized models or in some cases, if too difficult, prevents the realization of SDMs. Further, for many studies, the creation of SDMs is not the final result and the post-modelling processing can be equally arduous as other steps. SDMtoolbox is designed to facilitate many complicated pre- and post-processing steps commonly required for species distribution modelling and other geospatial analyses. SDMtoolbox consists of 59 Python script-based GIS tools developed and compiled into a single interface. A large set of the tools were created to complement SDMs generated in Maxent or to improve the predictive performance of SDMs created in Maxent. However, SDMtoolbox is not limited to analyses of Maxent models, and many tools are also available for additional analyses or general geospatial processing: for example, assessing landscape connectivity of haplotype networks (using least-cost corridors or least-cost paths); correcting SDM over-prediction; quantifying distributional changes between current and future SDMs; or for calculating several biodiversity metrics, such as corrected weighted endemism. SDMtoolbox is a free comprehensive python-based toolbox for macroecology, landscape genetic and evolutionary studies to be used in ArcGIS 10.1 (or higher) with the Spatial Analyst extension. The toolkit simplifies many GIS analyses required for species distribution modelling and other analyses, alleviating the need for repetitive and time-consuming climate data pre-processing and post-SDM analyses.},
