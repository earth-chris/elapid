              uncertainties",

  abstract = "As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate,
              understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important.
              Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological
              niche constraints are used to project future species
              distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the
              uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of
              the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations
              into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of
              data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We
              illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and
              two distributional algorithms, together with information on
              distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale
              future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most
              species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070.
              Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large
              losses of species in some ``hotspots'' of vulnerability.
              Differences in distributional shifts among species will change
              species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in
              similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these
              analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and
              uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to
              incorporate future conditions into conservation and management
              practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model
              projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong
              actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that
              the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and
              that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act
              despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the
              future, is not an option.",
